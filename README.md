# Hyperpaper Planner

Linked dayplanner pdf for large e-readers (reMarkable 1 & 2, Supernote, Boox, etc). Inspired by the Bullet Journal method, GTD, and other information management systems.

Custom full-year and school-year versions are now available for purchase! You can [order here](https://hyperpaper.me) and customize:
* Header layouts that leave space for your device's on-screen menus (reMarkable, Supernote, Boox Max Lumi)
* Day templates (lined or dotted, shaded working hours)
* Weekly tasks template (lined, dotted, kanban board)
* Quarterly template (lined, dotted)
* Extra linked collections of pages (Notes, Projects, Habit tracking, Meeting notes, custom sections of your choosing)
* **Date-aware collections** â€“ you can set up weekly/monthly collections where the current week/month is linked from every corresponding day page.

## Download 

2-month demo versions are available at https://hyperpaper.me/#try. There are demo variations for reMarkable/Supernote/Boox devices, with lined/dotted examples for each type of device.
